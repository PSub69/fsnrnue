  installer](https://github.com/leycec/fsnrnue/releases/download/2019.03.19/fsnrnue-2019.03.19-64.zip).**

## Installation

1. **Get _Fate/stay night [R√©alta Nua]_.** Sadly, all versions of *Fate/stay
   night* (including the most recent *[R√©alta Nua]* release) are unavailable
   for purchase and [thus constitute
   abandonware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abandonware). Instead:
   1. Search for these exact terms: [`nyaa "Fate/stay night [Realta Nua] for
      Windows"`](https://www.google.com/search?q=nyaa+%22Fate%2Fstay+night+%5BRealta+Nua%5D+for+Windows%22&oq=nyaa+%22Fate%2Fstay+night+%5BRealta+Nua%5D+for+Windows%22)
   1. Click on the topmost hit. <sup>...*probably*</sup>
   1. Download the 6.4GB directory `"Fate stay night Realta Nua/"` containing
      these six files:
      * `Fate.rar`.
      * `Fate Crack.rar`.
      * `Heaven's Feel.7z`.
      * `Heaven's Feel Crack.rar`.
      * `Unlimited Blade Works.rar`.
      * `Unlimited Blade Works Crack.rar`.
1. If your current platform is:
   * **Windows:**
     1. First, follow [steps 1, 2, and 3 *only* of the "Fate/Stay Night VN
        Installation Guide
        VII."](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatestaynight/comments/7qh6ho/fatestay_night_vn_installation_guide_vii)
     1. Then follow the [official Ultimate Edition instructions][ultimate-bl].
   * **Linux:**
     1. _(Recommended)_ **[Install *Wine
        Staging*](https://wiki.winehq.org/Wine-Staging).** See also
        instructions for:
        * [Debian-based distributions (e.g.,
          Ubuntu)](https://www.linuxuprising.com/2019/09/how-to-install-wine-staging-development.html).
     1. **[Install *Lutris*][lutris].**
     1. **Install _Fate/stay night \[R√©alta Nua\] Ultimate Edition_** with
        either:
        * *(Recommended)* **[Our one-click installer][installer-remote],**
          automating installation by transparently downloading and running this
          installer under *[Lutris][lutris].*
        * **Our offline installer,** manually runnable at the command line as
          follows:
          1. [Download this file][installer-local].
          1. Open a terminal to the directory containing that file.
          1. Copy-and-paste this command into that terminal:
         
                 lutris -i fate-stay-night-realta-nua-ultimate-edition.yml

   * **macOS is currently unsupported,** as [Lutris][lutris] is currently
     Linux-specific. In theory, porting our [Lutris-specific
     installer][installer-local] to [PlayOnMac][playonmac]
     *should* be feasible but non-trivial. If someone does so, please submit an
     [issue](https://github.com/leycec/fsnrnue/issues) or [pull
     request](https://github.com/leycec/fsnrnue/pulls) and we'll update these
     instructions accordingly.

## Configuration

We strongly recommend:

* **Enabling the *Patch* ‚Üí *Options* ‚Üí *Skip movies in-game* option.** Consider
  watching these movies either online or via the **_Extras_** title option 
  available after successfully completing the Prologue. Attempting to play
  movies usually raises fatal exceptions (e.g., at the fade-to-white Prologue
  ending) with error messages resembling one or more of:
  * `0009:fixme:gstreamer:mpeg_splitter_sink_query_accept Unsupported subtype {e436eb84-524f-11ce-9f53-0020af0ba770}.`
  * `00:15:24 ==== An exception occured at movie.tjs(210)[(function) open], VM ip = 81 ====`
  * `00:15:25 exception: (object 0x1184E098:0x1184E098)"Cannot convert the variable type ((void) to Object)"`
* **Disabling the *Patch* ‚Üí *Vita Additions* ‚Üí *Play Vita OP in-game* option.**
  In addition to raising fatal exceptions, Vita movies also contain heavy
  spoilers ‚Äì especially for Heaven's Feel, the final route and grand finale.
  (All remaining patches are spoiler-free.)
* **Enabling the *Display* ‚Üí *Aspect Ratio* ‚Üí *Standard* option** (i.e., the
  default) rather than the **_Wide_** option, which is known to be error-prone.

## FAQ

#### It doesn't even start, though?

Startup failures are *almost* always due to **corrupt patch downloads.** If
you see any of the following at startup, the Ultimate Edition installer failed
to properly download one or more patches for you:

* An untranslated GUI error message entitled with indecipherable Japanese kanji
  and text resembling:
  
  > ‚òê‚òê‚òê‚òê‚òê‚òê
  > file://./c/program/files/fate‚òêstay night[realta

* A translated GUI error message entitled "Script exception raised Read error"
  with text resembling:

#### That's what I'm seeing, I think?

**Great!** Well, not great ‚Äì but things could be worse. You could be Shiro in
any of the Dead Ends you're about to compulsively read just to collect all of
the Taiga Dojo stamps just to unlock a ridiculous hot springs bath scene.
<sup>Totally worth it.</sup>

So, we've confirmed the Ultimate Edition installer failed to properly download
one or more patches for you. These patches are locally corrupt and *must* be
[manually redownloaded from Google Drive links listed under the **Mandatory
patches** section of the original release notes for the Ultimate
Edition][ultimate-bl] into the
`fate-stay-night-realta-nua-ultimate-edition/drive_c/Program Files/FateÔºèstay
night[Realta Nua] Ultimate Edition/` subdirectory to which the Ultimate Edition
previously installed itself, overwriting each existing corrupt patch.

If you're unsure which corrupt patches need to be redownloaded, either blindly
redownload *all* of them or:

* Inspect the aforementioned subdirectory for 0-byte filenames prefixed by
  `patch_`: e.g.,

```

```

* Run *Fate/stay night* from the command line and search for text in the
  terminal buffer resembling:

```
01:36:36 (info) Trying to read XP3 virtual file system information from : file://./c/program files/fate^stay night[realta nua] ultimate edition/patch_decensor.xp3
01:36:36 (info) Failed.
01:36:36 ==== An exception occured at initialize.tjs(197)[(function) KAGLoadScript], VM ip = 16 ====
```

In both cases, the decensor patch (i.e., `patch_decensor.xp3`) is corrupt and
must be manually redownloaded. It would be the decensor patch, wouldn't it?

#### That's also not what I'm seeing.

‚Ä¶that's not even a question. You can tell because there's no question mark.

#### I'm seeing an error at "initialize.tjs(245)"?

Are you receiving an error resembling `"==== An exception occured at
initialize.tjs(245)[(top level script) global], VM ip = 840 ===="`? If yes,
then we're all on the same page, which is nice.

Did you also install the optional Vita patch? If:

* **Yes,** then [please try reinstalling *without* that
  patch](https://github.com/leycec/fsnrnue/issues/9).
* **No,** then continue to the next question.

#### That's also not what I'm seeing, though?

Then here's what we're going to do:

1. Run *Lutris.*
1. Right-click the *Fate/stay night* entry.
1. Click the *Show logs* menu item.
1. Copy the contents of the displayed log to the clipboard.
1. [Paste those contents into a new
   issue of our issue tracker](https://github.com/leycec/fsnrnue/issues/new).

We'll get you sorted right out. Promise.

#### I see something about Vulkan and `dxvk` in those logs, I think?

Do you see log errors resembling the following?

```
info: Game: Fate.exe
info: DXVK: v1.7.1-2-g743f309
info: Built-in extension providers:
info: Win32 WSI
info: OpenVR
warn: OpenVR: Failed to locate module
info: Required Vulkan extension VK_KHR_surface not supported
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'dxvk :: DxvkError'
Game is considered exited.
Initial process has exited.
All monitored processes have exited.
Exit with returncode 768
```

If so, **great!** Well, not great ‚Äì but things could be worse. You could always
be running Windows, which is like a real-life Dead End you inflict on yourself.

First, let's refresh your faded memories of obscure APIs and acronyms:

* **[Vulkan][vulkan]** is the official replacement for
  [OpenGL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL), a popular cross-platform
  GPU-accelerated 3D rendering API. So, [Vulkan][vulkan] = OpenGL 2.0. Sorta.
  Close enough.
* **[DXVK](dxvk)** is a [Vulkan][vulkan]-based Linux-specific translation layer
  that internally converts Windows-specific DirectX 9, 10, and 11 GPU logic
  into equivalent [Vulkan][vulkan] logic.

Next, let's inspect the warnings and errors in the above error message:

* The `"warn: OpenVR: Failed to locate module"` line is safely ignorable. That
  just means you don't have a virtual reality (VR) headset connected, which is
  fine. VR's nice and all, but that's not really what we're going for here.
* The `"info: Required Vulkan extension VK_KHR_surface not supported"` line is
  where your troubles start. **Your [Vulkan][vulkan] installation is broken.**
  That's bad, because it means you won't be able to run any GPU-accelerated
  [Vulkan][vulkan] games. Thankfully, *Fate/stay night* is so old that it runs
  on decades-old potato PCs manufactured by RadioShack and doesn't really
  benefit from GPU acceleration at all.

You have two options here:

* (*Recommended*) **Disable [Vulkan][vulkan] for *Fate/stay night*.** This is
  the easy way:
  1. Run *Lutris*.
  1. Right-click the *Fate/stay night* entry.
  1. Click the *Configure* menu item.
  1. Click the *Runner options* tab.
  1. Disable the *Enable DXVK/VKD3D* setting.
  1. You're done. *Praise Ilya!*
* **Fix your broken [Vulkan][vulkan] and [DXVK][dxvk] installation.** This is
  the hard way, but you probably want to do this eventually *anyway*.
  Instructions for properly installing and configuring [Vulkan][vulkan] and
  [DXVK][dxvk] vary by platform. For example, users on Arch-based Linux distros
  should:
  1. Follow [the Vulkan installation instructions at the Arch
     Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Vulkan#Installation).
  1. Follow [the Wine installation instructions at the Arch
     Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/wine#Installation). **Note:
     install `wine-staging` rather than `wine`.** Always use Wine Staging,
     which is the bleeding-edge version of Wine that provides [DXVK][dxvk].
     Never use standard Wine, which is the obsolete version of Wine that
     provides literally nothing.
  1. Watch [this YouTube video walking you through DXVK configuration under
     Lutris with Wine
     Staging](https://forums.lutris.net/t/how-to-setup-dxvk-on-lutris/1704).

When in doubt, just disable [Vulkan][vulkan] and [DXVK][dxvk].
