Fate/stay night [Réalta Nua] Ultimate Edition
=============================================

This repository [unofficially hosts GitHub-managed
downloads](https://github.com/leycec/fsnrnue/releases) for the third-party
[Fate/stay night \[Réalta Nua\] Ultimate
Edition](forums.nrvnqsr.com/showthread.php/8229) – a pair of 32- and 64-bit
Windows installers automating both the installation and patching of the
[Réalta Nua](https://typemoon.fandom.com/wiki/Fate/stay_night#R.C3.A9alta_Nua)
variant of the seminal Japanese visual novel [*Fate/stay
night*](https://typemoon.fandom.com/wiki/Fate/stay_night).

## but what?

[Current releases](https://github.com/leycec/fsnrnue/releases) include:

* **[64-bit Ultimate Edition
  installer](https://github.com/leycec/fsnrnue/releases/download/2019.03.19/fsnrnue-2019.03.19-64.zip).**
* **[32-bit Ultimate Edition
  installer](https://github.com/leycec/fsnrnue/releases/download/2019.03.19/fsnrnue-2019.03.19-32.zip).**

## but why?

...because the [official release
links](http://forums.nrvnqsr.com/showthread.php/8229) are all hosted at Google
Drive, whose user experience (UX) for large downloads [effectively prohibits
automated
downloads](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14728038/disabling-the-large-file-notification-from-google-drive).
This renders those links unusable from automated downstream installers (e.g.,
[Lutris](https://lutris.net), [PlayOnLinux](https://www.playonlinux.com/en)),
which is bad. This repository hosts alternative links compatible with headless
downloaders like [curl](https://curl.haxx.se) and
[wget](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget) commonly run from such installers,
which is good.
